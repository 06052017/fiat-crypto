What secrets do we have?

	- long-term signing key (shared across connections)
	- long-term pre-shared keys (zero or more per client)
	- per-session (optional) Diffie-Hellman secret key
    - derived from DH secret, DH shared key (still secret)

Signing key is used to sign some struct involving the DH public key and handshake transcript
DH shared key is used to authenticate the same struct
DH shared is used to authen application messages and decrypt messages from the wire, revealing whether the decryption succeeded and giving data to application.
pre-shared keys are used like DH shared keys, once
pre-shared keys are created based on some condition and then given to an authenticated client over an encrypted channel
both kinds of shared keys go through some splitting/key derivations for this...
there is a per-connection random value, used to distinguish between different connections
