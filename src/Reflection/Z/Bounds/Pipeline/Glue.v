(** The [reassoc_sig_and_eexists] tactic operates on a goal convertible with

{ f : { a | is_bounded_by bounds a }
| BoundedWordToZ f = rexprZ (BoundedWordToZ a) ... (BoundedWordToZ z) }

is_bounded_by bounds (map wordToZ ?f)
  /\ map wordToZ ?f = rexprZ (map wordToZ (proj1_sig a)) ... (map wordToZ (proj1_sig z))
